# TCC_material_server
Server for RBG and thermal Material Classification

For installation, follow the guide in https://github.com/deepneuroscience/DeepThermalImaging.

The RGB model is from https://github.com/dulucas/Material_Segmentation_PyTorch and you must obtain the model and place in the weights sub-folder

Then place the files contained in this repository inside the API sub-folder replacing the "deep_thermal_imaging_uitls" sub-folder.

The App can then be run by running app.py
